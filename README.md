**Abstract**

The final deliverable in the Software Engineering Bootcamp is the group project
software, Sacchon, a diabetes management web application. Each team will create
their own implementation based on a Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
document. The SRS is common to all, but each team can follow their own
assumptions and approaches. Sacchon is divided into two distinct subsystems, the
Sacchon Rest-API which is the backend and the Sacchon Angular App, which is
the frontend. To the end user, the web app consists of three major components:
the Repository of Medical Data (MediDataRepo), the Doctor Advice Services
System (DoctorAdvice), and the Reporting Services (Reporter).
MediDataRepo keeps track of the usersâ€™ blood glucose level, daily consumed
carbohydrates, and medication intake. In the DoctorAdvice section a team of
doctors provide advice to patients on a per-call basis. Reporter provides a series
of aggregation operations for creating tables and charts. Further details on the
business requirements of each component will be discussed in the class.

## 1 Introduction

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document gives an overview of
Sacchon, a diabetes management web application. It names what is required to be
analyzed, designed, implemented, tested, and presented. It also describes the
high-level requirements of the stakeholders based on their needs and
expectations, i.e. the desired product features.

## 2 Project scope

The project aim is to develop the Sacchon app and deliver it ready to be released.
The requirements are given by the Sacchon Consulting Enterprise (a fictional
company).

The information system must contain

1. A User Interface to submit and view medical data by the patients and
    doctors.
2. An Administration Console with user management, monitoring, and
    reporting capabilities of the system usage.

For the above features to be considered complete, the following functionality must
be provided

1. From the backend view, a corresponding call with a valid JSON object
    containing all needed information must be available, according to the
    specification of each case.
2. From the frontend view, a corresponding page consuming the service from
    the backend and presenting the suitable information must be available.

## 3 Deliverables

The deliverable of this project is the integrated platform of the back and the front
system of the Sacchon. This means that the following three subsystems must be
delivered:

- MediDataRepo, the Repository of Medical Data)
- DoctorAdvice, the Doctor Advice Services System
- Reporter, the Reporting Services

In the following sections, all needed functionality for each subsystem is defined.


## 4 Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Overview

The patient uses the system to store their data at any time. After a month of data
recording has elapsed, a doctor can review this data and provide advice to the
patient for the next month. This process is repeated until the patient or the doctor
unregisters from the system.

The Chief Doctor is an officer who can view reports which monitor the activity of
patients and doctors in the system.

The following sections list the functionality needed to be present for the system to
be considered complete.

### 4.2 MediDataRepo

The patient can
manage their account
sign up for an account
remove the account
store their data
blood glucose level (date, time, measured in mg/dL)
carb intake (measured in grams)
view
their average daily blood glucose level over a user- specified period
their average carb intake over a user-specified period
the current and past consultations from doctors
update
modify incorrect submitted data
delete incorrect submitted data

### 4.3 DoctorAdvice

The doctor can
manage their account
sign up for an account
remove the account
view patient record
browse the data for a single patient (patient data and
consultations)
search
find patients that have not had a consultation in the last month
consult
provide advice to a patient for the upcoming month (name of
medication and dosage)
update
modify a consultation to a patient

Initially a patient has not doctor consulting them. As soon as a month of data
recording has passed, the patient is ready to be consulted by a doctor.

Doctors search for patients for which advice is pending. Each doctor can see all
the patients that they consult and the patients that are new in the system.
Doctors cannot see patients that are consulted by other doctors. All doctors can
see the new patients.

When a doctor selects to consult a new patient, the patient becomes managed by
this doctor exclusively.

When a doctor leaves the system, their patients become available again for other
doctors to consult. Past consultations of these patients continue to refer to the
doctor who is leaving the system.

If a doctor modifies a consultation, the patient must see a warning as soon as
they enter the system, so that they know that some important information must
be reviewed.

A month is the period from the day of consultation to the same date next month
(say, from the 15th of June to the 14th of July). It is not a calendar month. The
next month for a patient starts as soon as a doctor has provided a consultation.
Until the new consultation arrives, the previous one is considered valid.

### 4.4 Reporter

This section is available only to the Chief Doctors in the application. The reports
available are:

1. The information submissions (personal monitor data) of a patient over a
    time range
2. The information submissions (consultations) of a doctor over a time
    range
3. The list of the patients who are waiting for a consultation and the time
    elapsed since they needed to have one
4. The list of the patients with no activity over a time range
5. The list of the doctors with no activity over a time range

## 5 Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Sacchon app

The Sacchon app must be able to run in any current major web browser.


#### Performance

To guarantee a good user experience, all calls to the backend must have a
maximum response time of 1 second (excluding network response time).

#### Version control

All code must make use of the Git version control system. Each team must create
its own single GitHub code repository.

**User interface**

A basic UI design with open source images will be used.

### 5.2 Sacchon application code

#### Development environment

The following set up is required:

1. The backend part of the system must be developed in Java 8 or greater.
2. Any IDE can be used for the implementation; JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA is
    preferred (but not required).
3. The frontend will be developed using the Angular Framework.
4. The underlying database system must be the Microsoft SQL Server
    Developer Edition.
5. Maven must be the tool to manage dependencies and the software
    development lifecycle.

#### Software interfaces

All functionality must be implemented by using HTTP calls returning information
in JSON format.

A software interface document must be created. This is to be read by external
software developers who may want to interface with the system. The document
must provide the following information:

- Give the list of communications including the description of the data that is
    being exchanged.
- Specify any constraints.
- Describe application or other software interface characteristics, including
    component names and versions, databases, operating systems, libraries,
    tools, etc. that must be known to the developers.

#### Testing


The system must be fully backed up by unit tests.

For testing the REST calls, a third-party tool should be utilized. Postman
(https://www.getpostman.com) is recommended as a commonly-used tool in this
area. Swagger can also interface with the deliverable for testing. Automating REST
calls testing is highly recommended.

#### Logging

A well-defined logging policy maintaining all information produced by the
software when running is mandatory. The logging policy must be documented
(e.g. name the specific log files, directories, the rotation policy etc.).

#### Exception handling

When handling software exceptions, every call must be guaranteed to return a
valid JSON document. This includes the cases where something went wrong in the
backend execution due to either development bugs or system causes. The end-
user must never see default error pages on the web browser. Depending on the
type of the call (the various CRUD actions), the proper HTTP code must be always
returned from the backend for further processing up front.

#### Deliverables

The application code must be delivered in a single project repository on GitHub,
on the master branch of the project. The required software interface document
must be included as project documentation in the same repository.
